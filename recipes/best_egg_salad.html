    <h2>Nothing Beats Delicious Egg Salad, So Versatile...</h2>

        <p>
            I started making this egg salad recipe as a way to use up <em>hard boiled eggs</em> 
            left over from Easter one spring. I thought it would be a one-and-done lunch—just an 
            easy way to use up my leftovers—but to my surprise, I got hooked. Before long, 
            I was boiling more eggs to make more egg salad. This stuff is seriously good!
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>This egg salad recipe is brighter and fresher than most.</strong> In my opinion, 
            it’s what a classic egg salad recipe really wants to be. It’s still rich, creamy, and 
            flavorful, but it uses far less mayo than is traditional. Lemon juice, Dijon mustard, 
            and (optional) capers give it a tangy, briny kick, and lots of fresh herbs take it over 
            the top.

            <li><strong>Red onion</strong> – For crunch and oniony bite.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh herbs</strong> – Chives and dill add freshness to the salad and enhance its savory flavor.</li>
